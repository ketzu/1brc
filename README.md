# 1BRC Challenge

For some fun I planned to implement a solution to the [1BRC](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc) in different languages I know.

Start with a simple version and maybe optimize later. Run on my local machine, so uncomparable to any other solutions.

### Measurement

As this is just for fun, I simply run 

```ps1
Measure-Command { <1brc comannd> | Out-Default }
```

### Results:

 * Simple Python: 18m44s
 * C++:
 * Rust:
 * Typescript:
